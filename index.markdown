Hi I am Ian! I am a self-taught game developer that has just recently started on game developing journey!

I am passionate about games, whether it be the game designs, game background storylines, game mechanics and visuals. I aspire to produce games which can bring immersive experience to players and at the same time provide much needed value to players along the gameplay. 

This is a portfolio which I will be using to showcase my works along my game developing journey.

Currently I am actively seeking for a job placement in the game industry.
