# About Me

Hi I am Ian! I was a self-taught game developer. I recently joined the game industry and worked as a client engineer after I transitioned from a web developer.

I am passionate about games, whether it be the game designs, game background storylines, game mechanics and visuals. I aspire to produce games which can bring immersive experience to players and at the same time provide values to players along the gameplay. After working as a full-fledged game developer, my enthusiasm have grown immensely and I am determined to find more success in my career.

This is a portfolio which I will be using to showcase my works along my game developing journey, as well as information of the production that I am involved.

Currently I am actively seeking for a job placement in the game industry. My resume can be found at the page's header, and my email address and LinkedIn profile can be found at the page's footer.
